Fun Facts:<br>

• Riot can't tell difference between skin changers & exploits XD <br>
• Riot's player support team copy pastes pre-written wall of texts without checking a shit <br>  
• Rioters differ per region & server, some have more iq than others <br>
• Rioters don't cooperate, if rioter A sayz / posts something in official Riot Discord & it violates the ToS - and is ok - You will get banned, cuse why not? <br>
• Rioters dont even know what they are doing to the game atm. <br>
• Riot has written a set of rules & tos, which they fail to follow. <br>
• Riot can violate their ToS, but you can't even after they say you so. <br>
